<h2>About the Site</h2>
<p>For my project I will be using an API containing information regarding spells from Dungeons and Dragons. The data set includes information such as a description of the spell its name, which school of magic it belongs to, level, range, and what classes can learn it. I will also be using two other json files that I have made myself, one involving classes and another involving the different schools of magic.   The tables involved in the database will include Spells (Spell name, school, Description, range, components, duration, casting time), Schools, Classes, and Class Spell List (Class Name, spell name). The school column of the spells table will be a foreign key and the class spell list table will be a join table designed to resolve the many-to-many relationship between classes and spells. </p>
